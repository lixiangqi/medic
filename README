This library contains a debugging tool, Medic, to provide an enhanced debugging experience with printf 
debugging. To get started, you can install the Medic package and build the documentation for a user
manual (refer to http://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/index.html for more details). The demos directory 
contains executable examples used in the documentation.
